# Emergencies

## Neurovascular Compromise

Any fracture that demonstrates clinical signs of neurovascular compromise should have an urgent orthopedic consultation obtained. Dislocations should be urgently reduced if the provider has appropriate training. Signs of neurovascular compromise include:

* Diminished capillary refill
* Weak or absent pulses
* Pallor
* Loss of sensation

## Open Fractures

### MD360 and outpatient settings

We recommend that all patients with open fractures should be directly transferred to the **Greenville Memorial** **Emergency Department** for urgent evaluation and treatment.
