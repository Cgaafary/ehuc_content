### [Stone Expulsion Rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5635101/) \(within 20 weeks\)

* 0-3 mm - 98%
* 4 mm - 81%
* 5 mm - 65%
* 6 mm - 33%
* â‰¥6.5 mm - 9%

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Irreversible renal injury can occur within 3 weeks in patients with a complete obstruction**

Some patients with moderate to large stones \(&gt;5 mm\) can become asymptomatic and delay follow up. Please emphasize compliance with follow up in patient's with large obstructive stones to avoid delay in care and permanent renal injury

## MD360 and Outpatient Settings

### ED Transfer
